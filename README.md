Correlation analysis
================

## Correlation analysis using large gene expression datasets

Analysis of correlations between a variable (e.g., TMB, age, etc.) and
gene expression across large-scale datasets. This repository contains
code, data processing workflows, and visualization tools for exploring
these relationships.

## Structure the R project as follow:

```
├── README.md
├── README_files      <- Files generated by .Rmd
├── data              <- Raw data, avoid editing directly.
├── data_interim      <- Intermidiate data that has be transformed.
├── data_processed    <- Final data sets for making plots and sharing.
├── scrips
|   ├── 1_process.r     <- Format raw data for analysis (varies by input)
|   ├── 2_correlation.r <- Correlation script
|   ├── 3_plots.r       <- Script for plots and table outputs
├── results             <- Generated plots, tables, ppts
```

### work in progress

You can include R code in the document as follows:

### work in progress

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
